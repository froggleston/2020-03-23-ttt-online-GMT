Please add your questions about logistics and preparation to the Etherpad. We will answer these questions in the etherpad during your work time and will return to this list later today.<br>- Charges of Carpentries workshops? Varies between workshpos. Some charge a small amount to cover coffee&#x2F;buiscuits... and also ensures people attendance. Others do it for Free. In any case the carpentries goal is to make these workshops accessible, the hosts have the call on how they want to do it as they think is more helpful.<br>- What&#x27;s a Carpentries workshop? We will discused in the afternoon. There a small requirement of what has to be taught and by who.<br>- GH pages rendered as websites? We have some practice this afternoon to use a workshop template and there&#x27;s more information about gh-pages <a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;help&#x2e;github&#x2e;com&#x2F;en&#x2F;github&#x2F;working&#x2d;with&#x2d;github&#x2d;pages&#x2F;creating&#x2d;a&#x2d;github&#x2d;pages&#x2d;site" rel="noreferrer noopener">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;github&#x2F;working-with-github-pages&#x2F;creating-a-github-pages-site</a><br><br><br><br><strong>Key Points</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Instructors guide learners to construct the proper big picture (accurate mental model) of the topic rather than focus on details.</li><li>Instructors rely on frequent feedback from learners to monitor their own presentation of the material.</li><li>Instructors introduce a few concepts at a time to avoid cognitive overload.</li><li>The best way to motivate learners?

Learers will see mistakes by the instructor and learn from this. The instructor will have to type and talk at the same time and that may be challenging.&nbsp;</li><li>Advantage: give an impression how coding looks like, prove that it&#x27;s not some kind of magic and show that errors can happen and it&#x27;s ok, and comment on the errors. Disadvantage: split attention, teacher has to concentrate on speaking and coding at the same time</li><li>From the learner&#x27;s point of view: getting engaged and getting the &quot;hands in the dirt&quot; very quickly (pro). However, there can happen a moment when the learner is just copying without understanding (con).&nbsp;</li><li>From the learner&#x27;s view: it is easier to ask questions during the coding that would otherwise be omitted, it feels more relatable specially if teacher makes a mistake or googles something in the middle, or to try what would happen if we change something in the code and why it works or not&nbsp;</li><li>From Learner&#x27;s view: advantages: more interest on learning Challenges; shyness to ask&nbsp; Instructor: more activeness, good output Challenges: time consuming</li><li>The learner would be more engaged and is practicing what they learn in real time</li><li>Possible technical difficulties, I have been to training sessions where many of the participants could not download the necessary software needed to be used due to the institution firewall&#x2F;permissions&nbsp;</li><li>Advantage for learner: &quot;lowering threshold&quot; by showing how it is done right away.</li><li>Disadvantage for instructor and learner: Instructor can be surprised by previous unencountered errors - cause for a lot of confusion for learners</li><li>Disadvantage for learner: Can sometimes be slower than just showing the code.</li><li>challenge for learners: making typos without realising and getting stuck on a certain line&#x2F;piece of code (or other unexpected errors)&nbsp;</li><li>advantage for learners: instructors may mistype, showing that it&#x27;s no big deal and they are humans too&nbsp;</li><li>Advantage: keeps people engaged, Challenge: hard to think, troubleshoot, and know where everyone is all the time, hard to guage your audience if you&#x27;re busy</li><li>Advantage : learners do what you do so they learn how to do it by their own, it&#x27;s pratical and useful,</li><li>Down : it&#x27;s slow, you have to be in good shape as instructor to motivate the class</li><li>&nbsp;</li><li>The instructor should be able to gauge, in real time, whether participants are able to keep up or not.</li><li>Students on the other hand can signal, using their sticky notes, whether they are able to keep up or not. Hopefully that mitigates the fear of sticking your hand up to say &quot;I don&#x27;t understand&quot;, or &quot;I lost the plot&quot;</ul><br><br><br><br><strong>Compare and Contrast (15 min)</strong><br>Watch the two live coding videos as a group and then summarize your feedback on both in the Etherpad.

Preparing to Teach</strong><br><a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;carpentries&#x2e;github&#x2e;io&#x2F;instructor&#x2d;training&#x2F;15&#x2d;lesson&#x2d;study&#x2F;index&#x2e;html" rel="noreferrer noopener">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;carpentries.github.io&#x2F;instructor-training&#x2F;15-lesson-study&#x2F;index.html</a><br><br><strong>Learner Profiles</strong><br><br><strong>Learner Profiles (10 min)</strong><br>Read Software Carpentry&#x27;s learner profiles ( <a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;software&#x2d;carpentry&#x2e;org&#x2F;audience&#x2F;" rel="noreferrer noopener">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;software-carpentry.org&#x2F;audience&#x2F;</a> ). Note that these example profiles contain more information than you will ever know about a learner; this is a creative exercise in imagining (and empathizing with) the whole people behind the faces. Now, sketch out a profile of someone you might expect to attend your first workshop. Who are they, what problems do they face, and how might this training help them? Be as specific as possible.<br>Enter your learner profile below.<br><br>Mark: Helen is a beginning PhD student in industrial design. She needs to collect and process all kinds of data on industrial coffee machines. This data comes from various sources and has many different formats. Helen will use scripts to manipulate the data, git to manage her scripts, and will be given pointers on where to store and manage her datafiles.<br><br>Kristian: Steward Student keeps getting told that he has to learn R. He needs it for studies, his project and future job. He normally studies social sciences and has never seen programming languages before. He is motivated more by the fear of not being able to follow along if he does not attend rather than actually being excited about the possibilities of the program. Attending the Carpentry workshop he is currently at is not a requirement but he still feels as if he has to. He only has experience with using software like Microsoft Office.<br><br>Maria: a phd student with no background in stats or programming experience, but good understanding of their problem area and a specific RQ, but no clean data<br>a colleague with a messy dataset and some ideas about the paper to write<br>a CEO of a company with data and a particular business problem to solve&nbsp;<br>Sudarshan: Himal is a biotech student in Nepal, he wants to learn genomics but he isnot privileged to such trainining, mentorships. He has no such experiences to programming but he has experiences of bioinformatics theoreticallyas hehas take courses in his undergrad. Carpentries training workshop can help to learn what he is passionately wants to learn since years.&nbsp;<br>Sarah: Maria is a molecular biology student. She has produced RT-QPCR data of her own. She gets tables out of it, that contain gene expression estimations per sample. She would like learn enough R to be able to plot her results, so as not to depend too much on colleagues to do so. She has a basic level of bash programming that she aquired recently. Software carpentries will teach Maria how to import and manipulate her data in R, and get started on producing those graphs.<br>A person who has never seen a shell and knows only GUIs, but is really good at spreadsheets, knows how to use functions there, sort, order, etc. University background in social sciences, but has not been in an academic environment (in a seminar) for many years.<br><br>Paloma: Camila is a public health master student who will have to clean and prepare data before running any analysis, she is very enthusiastic. She has never programmed and that scares her, other students have used SPSS and discourage her of learning R. Guided tutorials will help her loose the fear and realize that with a few lines of code she can do great things (like with ggplot).<br><br>Jenny: X is a&nbsp; college student in a rural university. They don&#x27;t understand yet how to visualize data but has some familiarity with shell scripting and basic python syntax. They would like to use coding for their homework exercises and eventually to help them visualize and analyze data from an undergraduate research experiment, measuring some biological marker from local flora.<br>Raphaela: Hans is a senior researcher at a university. He has programmed in Python many years ago but now exlucisvely uses matlab. His PhD students and colleagues write code in Python and there are issues with interfacing the different languages and pieces of code. He wants to pick up Python again to write compatible code. This training could help him to remember what he learnt about Python and transition him from version 2.x to 3.x.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Mathilda is a PhD student she has no experience in programming but she has to do a lot of data analysis for studing chloridric solutions. For now, she is using Excel and GUI programs, she is interested by learning python for automasing the data filtring and ploting processes. The SWC will help her to start using the python environment an show to her how to load and plot her data. [<br><br>Rachel: James is doing a PhD in Ecology focusing on Koala tracking, he has very little experience in Python or R and has been tasked by his supervisor to investigate the possible solution to his data processing and analysis needs.&nbsp; James doesn&#x27;t really know where to start so is going to complete the software carpentry introductory courses and some of the data carpentry courses.&nbsp;<br><br>Jannetta: Hadib is an energy engineer. He has been working on a model using MatLab<br>Hadib works with two other engineers on the same model but different parts.

This is also a good time to ask questions about teaching demonstration.<br><br>Next, get back into the same groups you did your live coding with. Take turns re-teaching your chosen live coding session, making sure to incorporate changes based on the feedback you received and any new ideas based on reading the rubric.

It comes with not leaving in my comfort zone, though, so I am not sure it is the best strategy.<br>The assisting instructor should probably not correct the instructor, unless a big mistake has been said? As much as possible, it is good to avoid contradicting one another in front of the classroom (discussion is obviously fine though).<br>- (Rob) I think it depends - if the co-instructor has made a big error, politely ask them to clarify? &quot;Sorry X, I thought that the command was used like..... Is this correct?&quot; But yes, you&#x27;re correct - instructors should support each other so that they are presented as experts in the room as knowledgeable places of information and help.<br>In terms of comfort zones, it&#x27;s expected that all instructors can teach all elements of the materials, but inevitably people will prefer some lessons over others. Work with the co-instructor to decide who is going to teach what and how comfortable you both are ahead of time!<br><br>I would prefer not to teach for a full day, and instead split it half and half with the co-teacher, I&#x27;m not sure if I could stay really engaging and excited for learners in a whole day. I have been at a Carpentries lesson where the co-teacher just sat on their phone, I didn&#x27;t think that was very supportive to their co-teacher and thought they could have potentially acted as a helper as there were alot of times where participants were waiting long times for assistance with pink sticky notes on their laptops.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>- (Rob) Indeed, and we would hope that instructors wouldn&#x27;t teach for a whole day. That would get very tiring. Co-instructors sitting on their phone is ususual. Hopefully there would be opportunities for helpers and the main instructor to ask them for help - as an Instructor when I&#x27;m teaching, if I see pink stickies and see a helper&#x2F;co-instructor hanging around, I&#x27;ll explicitly ask them to address any stickies in the room<br><br>I would prepare by discussing who is responsible for which tasks and presentations, mostly based on who is most comfortable with each of the topics. During the workshop, I think it would be great if the assisting instructor could keep an eye on the room and (discretly?) notify me about things to pay attention to.<br>- (Rob) Yes, that would be a good idea - make sure that your co-instructor is happy to do so by discussing what that might look like in a workshop prior to teaching the workshop.<br><br><strong>Minute Cards Revisited (5 min)</strong><br>Use your sticky notes to write minute cards as discussed yesterday.<br><a href="https&#x3a;&#x2F;&#x2F;pinup&#x2e;com&#x2F;BBqedig1V" rel="noreferrer noopener">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pinup.com&#x2F;BBqedig1V</a><br><br><strong>Key Points</strong><br><ul class="bullet"><li>Working with a broad range of learners can be challenging, but there are many ways to keep a classroom happy and motivated.</li><li>Response to a Code-of-Conduct violation at a workshop is subject to instructor discretion, but all violations should be reported to the Carpentries for follow-up.</ul><br><strong>XV.

(Rob) Usually through pull requests for contributions, and mandatory attendance at one of the checkout sessions and discussion sessions<br>(Jenny) Can you add the link to the website of your chosen lesson later? (Rob) Yes, but at least one week in advance<br>(Kristian) Will someone notify us, if the discussion isn&#x27;t happening? (Rob) Yes there would be emails sent around notifying you of any changes to the discussion time&#x2F;date<br>(Sarah) trainers vs instructors? trainers are the ones actually building the material? (Rob) No - anyone can suggest materials but it&#x27;s commonly certified instructors who maybe don&#x27;t teach as often but contribute to lesson development as their contribution to the community. Some do both of course!<br>(Sudarshan) Is there any financial assistance from Carpentries to organize workshops? (Rob) Travel and subsistence usually, but no &quot;salary&quot; compensation.<br>(Kristian) Are the Carpentries associated with CodeRefinery? (Rob) No but we&#x27;re friends! :)<br>(Sudarshan) Do we have to take next training for being eligible to teach? (Rob) If you mean that do you need to become a Trainer to teach, then no.

Good visual content: not too much text, some pictures and graphs (either on slide&#x2F;page or live-drawn). Clear schedule described at the beginning, so you know what to expect and when. Workshops I don&#x27;t like: instructor looking bored, speaking with a monotonous voice, telling that things are obvious when they are not at all to you. Instructors who look like they would like to be anywhere else but there teaching you. No or not enough hands on.<br>I like when a teacher does not stick to the hierarchy: teacher - student. I also appreciate if he&#x2F;she is competent and confident. Besides, a good teacher feels the audience and adapts to it, monitor its response, even if it is non-verbal.<br>Jenny: I think I don&#x27;t like courses that are too general. I get confused as to what I am supposed to be learning, or why it is useful to learn the material. I like clear, upfront objectives, especially for coding workshops, where it is easy to get lost in the weeds. I like when there is a story behind the data, and when instructors bring personal experiences to the table.<br>Mark: an enthousiastic instructor can make up for many other faults. So if the whole setup is a bit amateuristic, but the teachers is enthousiastic and able, it&#x27;s usually still good!<br>Raphaela: one particular session comes to mind, where the instructor was very enthusiastic about the topic. He gave very nice motivating examples, went stept by step through different approaches. He was also present and involved in the labs, which I found especially engaging, since they were organised by his PhD student. By him being there and helping, I got the impression that he really cared about us understanding the material. I think many of us were really excited about the topic for some while after the course, I surely was.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Rachel: I really like when a workshop introduction covers what I will get out of the class and what the teachers expectations are of the participants.&nbsp; I also really appreciate understanding the real world application of the skills I&#x27;m going to be learning.&nbsp; When I completed the Python software carpentries course the instructor was an expert and made alot of assumptions on people&#x27;s prior knowledge of programming, the instructor dived straight in, it would have been nice to have some kind of icebreaker and understand some of the applications of what we were learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Kristian: Courses&#x2F;workshops with unclear prerequisites. I recently attended a workshop on how to use a AI node that our university had installed. The workshop was supposed to be on how to run the code on it but it apparently required rather in-depth knowledge of using shell, understanding virtual machine, understanding programming environments etc. This was not made clear and the instructor just wrote a bunch of shell commands without explaining what was happening.<br>Positive courses&#x2F;workshops are mostly characterized by the fact that the instructor is passionate about the material.&nbsp;<br>Maria: when instructor is enthusiastic and passionate about the material it makes the whole difference. The topic itself may be less of your interest but the energy is contageous.<br><br>Paloma: I really appreciate when the course begins with what to expect and what will not be covered, and brief description of the syllabus and resources (not very often). I appreciate when the introduction calls to the problem that we try to solve, so it puts a context to the topic because that makes it engaging. I disliked courses that inmediatly begin with heavy theoric background, very mathy unnecesarely and no relation to a real settings.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br><strong>What&#x27;s in an Introduction?
